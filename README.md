# Warehouse Robot Optimization using Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing the navigation and operational efficiency of warehouse robots using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The RL agent learns optimal policies to navigate warehouse environments, improving task completion speed and reducing operational costs.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenAI Gym (for environment simulation)
- Stable Baselines / Custom RL implementations
- Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and visualization
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.

## Project Details
- Designed an RL environment to simulate warehouse robot movement.
- Implemented RL algorithms (Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network, or others) to optimize navigation.
- Evaluated performance using reward functions and path efficiency metrics.
- Visualized training progress and final policy performance.

## Dataset / Environment
- Simulated warehouse environment created using OpenAI Gym or a custom simulator.
- No external dataset required.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: 
2.  Install dependencies:
3.  Run the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook warehouse_robot_optimization.ipynb

## Results
- Achieved improved path efficiency for the warehouse robot.
- Reduced average task completion time by XX% after training.
- Detailed performance analysis is available in the project report.
